## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I have learnt for this challenge is to centre the profile card when the position of it is "absolute". I am also able to practice elements' positioning as their position is also "absolute".

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

To be able to stack more than 2 elements and position them correctly based on the design made.

### Useful resources

- [Centering using Absolute Position](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/positioning) - This helped me centre the profile card component.
